# Service-specific configuration file for fuse-smx. This will be
# sourced by the SysV init script, thus allowing values to be
# overridden in a per-service manner.
#
# To change values for a specific service make your edits here.
# To create a new service create a link from
# /etc/init.d/<your new service> to /etc/init.d/fuse-smx (do not copy
# the init script) and make a copy of the /etc/sysconfig/fuse-smx
# file to /etc/sysconfig/<your new service> and change the property
# values so the two services won't conflict. Register the new
# service in the system as usual (see chkconfig and similar).
